# bookingbookbot

## Disclaimer
This project wants to be a working exercise with telegram bot and Google app script and javascript as well.
Due to other projects that are making my days full I'm not able to adjust and rewrite the code that became a mess in different parts.
Anyway, I'm increasing it in my spare time increasing the features adopting an Agile approach but taking no time to refactor it. I hope someday...

This example uses an app script application to get and send messages from/to a telegram bot.
It aims to store reservations in a google spreadsheets file.
It uses a GCP speech to text service to recognise a voice message.
